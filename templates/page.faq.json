            "answer": "<p>The easiest and best way to find out is to get a baseline hearing test (AKA: Audiogram) performed by an Audiologist or Hearing Instrument Specialist. Often, one of the first clues of hearing loss is that your ability to hear and understand in background noise is challenged. If you’ve ever been out at a bar or cafe with friends and found yourself smiling and nodding along but only catching bits and pieces of what they’re saying. If the background sound of music or a whirling espresso machine prohibits you from understanding what someone is saying, it is a good idea to get a baseline hearing test.</p><p>&lt;br&gt;</p><p>Relax, this isn’t the kind of test you need to study for. For many adults, the last hearing test they had was in grade school. Most find a lot has changed since then, including how well they hear. Since hearing loss is often a slow and gradual process, it can be hard to realize on your own. It’s a good idea to get your hearing tested, especially if you suspect you have hearing loss symptoms (or someone has playfully hinted at such). Growing evidence shows that initial of hearing loss occurs (on average) in our 30s and 40s…so, we encourage getting a baseline decades sooner than most do currently.</p>",

So, before our audiologists can prescribe a personalized device for your wants and needs, we want to know ALL the details of your hearing health.</p><p>This is where a hearing test comes in. This test assesses the health of your outer, middle, and inner ears. It also assesses:</p><ul><li>Your ability to hear at different intensities across different frequencies</li><li>Your ability to understand speech</li><li>Your ability to understand speech in background noise</li><li>How well your ears respond to loud noises</li><li>If there are any differences in hearing between your left and right ears</li></ul><p>This info ensures we give you everything you need to hear better, better.</p>",
