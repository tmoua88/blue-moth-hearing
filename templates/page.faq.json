            "question": "How do I know if I have hearing loss?",
            "answer": "<p>The easiest and best way to find out is to get a baseline hearing test (AKA: Audiogram) performed by an Audiologist or Hearing Instrument Specialist. Often, one of the first clues of hearing loss is that your ability to hear and understand in background noise is challenged. If you’ve ever been out at a bar or cafe with friends and found yourself smiling and nodding along but only catching bits and pieces of what they’re saying. If the background sound of music or a whirling espresso machine prohibits you from understanding what someone is saying, it is a good idea to get a baseline hearing test.</p><p>Relax, this isn’t the kind of test you need to study for. For many adults, the last hearing test they had was in grade school. Most find a lot has changed since then, including how well they hear. Since hearing loss is often a slow and gradual process, it can be hard to realize on your own. It’s a good idea to get your hearing tested, especially if you suspect you have hearing loss symptoms (or someone has playfully hinted at such). Growing evidence shows that initial of hearing loss occurs (on average) in our 30s and 40s…so, we encourage getting a baseline decades sooner than most do currently.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>The difference between a hearing screening and a hearing test is like the difference between a great first date and that pivotal moment when you just know you want to spend the rest of your life with someone.</p><p>The type of hearing loss that warrants hearing aids (the most common), known as Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL), is a forever kind of thing. So, before our audiologists can prescribe a personalized device for your wants and needs, we want to know ALL the details of your hearing health.</p><p>This is where a hearing test comes in. This test assesses the health of your outer, middle, and inner ears. It also assesses:</p><ul><li>Your ability to hear at different intensities across different frequencies</li><li>Your ability to understand speech</li><li>Your ability to understand speech in background noise</li><li>How well your ears respond to loud noises</li><li>If there are any differences in hearing between your left and right ears</li></ul><p>This info ensures we give you everything you need to hear better, better.</p>",

            "question": "How do I know what devices are OTC or Prescription?",
            "answer": "<p>To be really honest, it’s getting harder to tell which is which. That’s one of the reasons we founded BLUEMOTH – we wanted “radical transparency” in the world of hearing wellness and technology. Here’s the key: did you have to take a hearing test with a licensed provider? And, was that prescriptive test used in programming and fitting your hearing technology specifically to you? If the answers are yes, then you likely have a prescription device. If you’re offered an online “hearing test,” no hearing test, or self-selected settings – chances are high that you’re exploring the land of OTC.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>Another good tell for OTC products is that they’re designed for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. Prescription hearing aids, on the other hand, can address a much broader range of hearing loss needs.</p><p>Prescription hearing technology is more flexible in this way because they’re so customizable. Prescription aids can be tailored to your unique hearing profile, preferences, and listening environments. OTC products have more limited or fixed settings, so they can’t always adapt to you. As you work with us, you’ll get a first-hand taste of what this means.</p><p>Typically, another difference you’ll notice as a customer is the premium feel of going prescription compared to OTC. While OTC is good for a simple fix, prescription hearing aids usually incorporate advanced features and technologies. That can mean directional microphones, feedback cancellation, and fancy signal processing algorithms. The other half of the premium feel is professional support and follow-up care. Prescription hearing aids mean you get audiologist attention from your fitting to counseling to continuing check-ups.</p>",

          "settings": {
            "question": "Are OTC products any good?",
            "answer": "<p>OTC devices are getting better all the time. They’re great options for someone who has no medical issues with their ears, has minimal hearing loss, and wants a basic “boost.” We like to use the analogy of “readers” or “cheaters” in the glasses realm. We have to give a loving PSA as audiologists that it is best practice to have a hearing test performed to assess your hearing loss(and confirm that earwax or underlying medical issues aren’t culprits). An audiologist can help you understand if prescription devices or OTC would serve you best. There’s power in knowing!</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>The most important deciding factor that makes OTC products good is whether or not they’re good for <strong>you</strong>! Your specific hearing, lifestyle, and needs when it comes to hearing correction will all play into whether OTC technologies are a good fit. Not to mention, what works for one person may not be the best support for another.</p><p>Some of the good to consider with OTC hearing technology is that it tends to be accessible, affordable, and convenient. What’s missing tends to be customization, professional guidance, and a lack of advanced features when compared to prescription technology.</p><p>With BLUEMOTH, you get the best of both worlds with all the pros of prescription hearing aids alongside a more convenient and life-friendly approach when you have the option to try your tech at home before you buy and access to a more equitable price point.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>This list is going to be constantly changing, but a few on the market now are Jabra (previously Lively), Eargo, Nano, Lexie, and Lucid.</p><p><strong>Gimme more!</strong></p><p>If you choose an OTC device, regardless of brand, you have the option to make your purchase in-store or online. You will need to fit and adjust your OTC device yourself. For some, this independence sounds like a dream. For others, the dream is finding prescription technology and tackling fitting and adjustments under the care of an audiologist with access to holistic hearing wellness resources and follow-ups. </p><p>The FDA regulates OTC hearing tech as medical devices for adults.</p>",
