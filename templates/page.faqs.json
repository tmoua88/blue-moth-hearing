            "answer": "<p>The easiest and best way to find out is to get a baseline hearing test (AKA: Audiogram) performed by an Audiologist or Hearing Instrument Specialist. Often, one of the first clues of hearing loss is that your ability to hear and understand in background noise is challenged. If you’ve ever been out at a bar or cafe with friends and found yourself smiling and nodding along but only catching bits and pieces of what they’re saying. If the background sound of music or a whirling espresso machine prohibits you from understanding what someone is saying, it is a good idea to get a baseline hearing test.</p><p>Relax, this isn’t the kind of test you need to study for. For many adults, the last hearing test they had was in grade school. Most find a lot has changed since then, including how well they hear. Since hearing loss is often a slow and gradual process, it can be hard to realize on your own. It’s a good idea to get your hearing tested, especially if you suspect you have hearing loss symptoms (or someone has playfully hinted at such). Growing evidence shows that initial of hearing loss occurs (on average) in our 30s and 40s…so, we encourage getting a baseline decades sooner than most do currently.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>The difference between a hearing screening and a hearing test is like the difference between a great first date and that pivotal moment when you just know you want to spend the rest of your life with someone. </p><p>The type of hearing loss that warrants hearing aids (the most common), known as Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL), is a forever kind of thing. So, before our audiologists can prescribe a personalized device for your wants and needs, we want to know ALL the details of your hearing health.</p><p>This is where a hearing test comes in. This test assesses the health of your outer, middle, and inner ears. It also assesses:</p><ul><li>Your ability to hear at different intensities across different frequencies</li><li>Your ability to understand speech</li><li>Your ability to understand speech in background noise</li><li>How well your ears respond to loud noises</li><li>If there are any differences in hearing between your left and right ears</li></ul><p>This info ensures we give you everything you need to hear better, better.</p>",

            "question": "What causes hearing loss?",
            "answer": "<p>The most common cause is the natural process of aging – however, most don’t realize this begins as young as our 30s and 40s! It truly is part of the natural process of aging, NOT an indicator of being old. Other common causes are noise exposure (wear your earplugs to concerts, friends!), genetics, excessive earwax, trauma, and medical conditions.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more! </strong></h3><p>Some hearing loss risk factors like age, illness, and genetics aren’t ours to choose. For the factors we get a say in, protection is undoubtedly key. Noise on the job, specifically loud and constant noise, can contribute to hearing loss. Think of professions such as farming, construction, factory work, dentristry, and performing. Protective equipment in the workplace can go a long way to reducing hearing damage.</p><p>Playing hard can take just as much of a toll as working hard. Think of hobbies like firearms, motorcycling, carpentry, and just plain old blasting the jams way too loud a little too often. If any of these sound like you, don’t forget your PPE, especially regarding your precious hearing. Earmuffs and earplugs are where it’s at.</p><p>If you’re putting two and two together about risk factors and your suspected hearing loss, we got you. Get your hearing tested, and let’s work together to bring you hearing tech for your lifestyle.</p><h3><strong>Down the rabbit hole.</strong></h3><h3><strong>Why does aging cause (sensorineural) hearing loss?</strong></h3><p>Have you ever had your carpet cleaned? Take a moment to imagine opening a front door to a large living room with light grey carpeting throughout that hasn’t had a proper cleaning in many years. It won’t take long to notice that the path from the entryway to the next room is noticeably more broken in than the rest of the area. Just like the living room, the landscape of your inner ear is carpeted with inner hair cells.</p><p>Your inner ear, AKA: cochlea, is wrapped like a snail. Sound travels from the base, where the low-frequency receptors live to the apex, where the high-frequency receptors live. All high-frequency sounds must travel through the low frequencies to arrive where the high-frequency sounds register.</p><p>Once enough hair cells are damaged or die due to heavy auditory traffic, hearing and the ability to understand speech sounds (especially in background noise) start to deteriorate, AKA: “hearing loss”. This auditory “foot traffic” wears down those hair cells. Once a hair cell dies, there is no resurrection.</p><p>The longer you’re alive, the more wear and tear on those hair cells. The more unprotected exposure to noise you endure, the more wear and tear. Therefore, you don’t need to be elderly to experience hearing loss; you just need a lot of auditory foot traffic.</p>",

            "question": "Do I need two hearing aids, or can I just get one?",
            "answer": "<p>We’ll always shoot it straight with you – if you have hearing loss in both ears, you need two devices. Just like you need two shoes for both your feet or two lenses in your glasses, you need a device for each ear. We program each one separately based on each ear’s hearing loss. If you only have hearing loss in one ear, we will review your uploaded test results and consult with you before moving forward. We want to know more about one-sided hearing loss in case you need more intensive local medical care for an underlying issue.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>Many people have hearing loss in both ears. Even if one ear is better than the other, they’re probably in a similar neighborhood. Most people who need two devices for their hearing loss are more satisfied with the experience of having both. It’s important that you don’t feel “lopsided” with only half the treatment you need.</p><p>Getting two hearing aids also helps you take advantage of your binaural hearing better. That’s what the way your brain processes sound signals from both ears is called. When sound enters your left ear, it’s processed on the right side of your brain. When sound enters the right ear, it’s processed on the right side. Then, the hemispheres work together to make sense of things. Turns out, using both sides noticeably improves your ability to understand speech.</p><p>In normal hearing, the sound signals from both ears would be the same. But with only one hearing aid, the signals from one ear will always be stronger. This can make it difficult to distinguish between voices and background noises or the location of sounds.</p><h3><strong>Down the Rabbit Hole.</strong></h3><p>A few additional benefits of binaural hearing are:</p><ul><li>Experience research has shown that those who have hearing loss in both ears rate their experience of using two hearing aids higher than using just one ear with poorer hearing.</li><li>Sound localization. You have an easier time determining where sound is coming from with proper amplification in each ear.</li><li>Both ears stay active, so your brain stays active, too.</li><li>Improved sound quality.</li><li>Tinnitus relief.</li><li>Ease of listening, less tax on your brain.</li></ul>",

            "question": "Is my hearing “bad enough” for hearing devices? Or could/should I wait?",
            "answer": "<p>The plain and simple truth is that if you have ANY hearing loss, you would benefit from getting a correction. Just like vision, there is no benchmark of “bad enough<strong>”</strong> – if you have a vision impairment, you need glasses or contacts. Same thing here; there is also an immense amount of research showing that getting started earlier with corrections benefits you and your brain and keeps things working well.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>A recent study revealed that only about 15% of adults in the US who need a hearing aid actually wear one. That sucks! And not because we sell them. It sucks because so many people could (but don’t) get the benefits of the right hearing technology in their life.</p><p>One common thread with hearing loss is the frequent reporting of feelings of loneliness. People can feel disconnected from their loved ones, communities, and hobbies because they struggle to hear well. We never want you to feel isolated or left out. Getting care for your hearing health puts you back in the loop.</p><h3><strong>Down the rabbit hole.</strong></h3><h3><strong>How are cognitive health and hearing health interrelated?</strong></h3><p>The relationship between cognitive health and hearing health can be best described by explaining the ear-to-brain connection.</p><p>Your ears collect sound, but it is your brain that understands sound. The ear-to-brain connection requires auditory nerve stimulation. Without stimulation, the nerves begin to die, and once they’re dead, they can’t be resurrected. The death of those inner hair cells is categorized as sensorineural hearing loss. By treating hearing loss, you can provide auditory stimulation through amplification. Treatment, AKA: amplification, can make it possible to continue creating connections and help your brain stay healthy, which overall makes a significant impact on your overall vitality. WIN!</p><p>Research reinforces that HEARING health is BRAIN health. Hearing health can be achieved by monitoring for hearing loss and treating any level of hearing loss and/or tinnitus.</p><h3><strong>Other relationships between hearing health and brain health are:</strong></h3><ul><li>Untreated hearing loss increases social isolation.</li><li>Physical fitness. Untreated hearing loss and social isolation result in less physical activity.</li><li>Cerebral Atrophy (Brain shrinkage), eek.</li><li>Cognitive Overload. People with untreated hearing loss work much harder to hear when in background noise.</li></ul><h3><strong>Four major benefits of treating hearing loss.</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Increased quality of life. </strong><em>People with untreated hearing loss report improvement in overall quality of life, self-esteem, and close relationships after the medical treatment of hearing loss and tinnitus.</em></li><li><strong>Measurable Increased Cognitive Function.</strong> <em>Medical Treatment of Hearing Loss Improves Cognitive Function after only two weeks of prescribed use and shows a significant increase in selective attention, memory recall, and processing speed.</em></li><li>By providing proper stimulation to the brain, you can<strong> reduce tinnitus.</strong></li><li><strong>Reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia.</strong> Source: <em>According to the Lancet Commission. 2020, </em>We now know that 4/10 cases of dementia are considered PREVENTABLE. In order of importance, the most modifiable lifestyle factor in reducing one’s risk of cognitive decline and dementia is treating hearing loss, which was listed as the <strong>most</strong> <strong>important</strong> way to prevent dementia, even more important than reducing alcohol or hypertension (which are both totally important).</li></ul>",

            "answer": "<p>Tinnitus is a perception of sound within a person’s ears and/or head. It is often described as ringing, buzzing, hissing. It can vary in volume, pitch, and frequency.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>With tinnitus, there is a perceived sound but no external sound source. This means it can only be heard by the person experiencing it. Tinnitus can be temporary or chronic and can have an array of effects on people. For some, it might only be a passing annoyance. For others, it can interfere with concentration and sleep, leading to stress, anxiety, and even depression.</p><p>With the proper treatment and support, tinnitus doesn’t have to dampen your quality of life permanently. Many people can find ways to cope effectively: including hearing technologies, therapy, and relaxation techniques. We hope to be part of our journey to a solution.</p><p>Have you heard of phantom limb pain? Essentially, tinnitus is no different. We discussed the death of inner hair cells and how it results in Sensorineural Hearing Loss. Tinnitus, or the perception of sound when no objective sound source is present, can present for several reasons.</p><h3><strong>Down the rabbit hole.</strong></h3><p>One of the most common reasons for tinnitus is untreated hearing loss. About 90% of people with tinnitus have hearing loss. One of the easiest ways to explain this phenomenon, as it relates to hearing loss, is that the brain is used to receiving ear-to-brain signals when sound is registered at different frequencies. When there is high-frequency hearing loss, the brain searches for those signals, and when it does not find them because the inner hair cells have died or are damaged, the brain will create signals (AKA: phantom sounds) in their absence (AKA: tinnitus).</p>",

For others, it is caused by emotional and/or physical trauma, noise exposure, or underlying medical conditions.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>There is an extensive range of causes related to tinnitus. The most common and well-known is loud noise exposure. Aging can also be a factor. As we age naturally and our bodies (and ears!) change, the structure of the inner ear may naturally deteriorate. This can sometimes cause tinnitus. Another possible cause is pressure from earwax blockage.</p><p>But wait, there’s more! Unfortunately, some medications can cause or worsen tinnitus. This includes some chemotherapy drugs, some antibiotics, and some antidepressants. Some ear and sinus infections can even cause tinnitus.</p>",

In cases where correction doesn’t adequately treat tinnitus alone, additional therapies, apps, and counseling will be added to your management plan.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>Hearing aids amplify sounds and improve overall hearing. When external sounds are enhanced, it can draw the focus away from tinnitus. Many modern hearing aids also have special features for addressing tinnitus. These usually generate low-level background sounds like white noise or gentle nature tones. These pleasant noises can help either wholly or partially mask your tinnitus.</p><p>It’s also believed that auditory stimulation from hearing aids promotes neuroplastic brain changes.

            "answer": "<p>To be really honest, it’s getting harder to tell which is which. That’s one of the reasons we founded BLUEMOTH – we wanted “radical transparency” in the world of hearing wellness and technology. Here’s the key: did you have to take a hearing test with a licensed provider? And, was that prescriptive test used in programming and fitting your hearing technology specifically to you? If the answers are yes, then you likely have a prescription device. If you’re offered an online “hearing test,” no hearing test, or self-selected settings – chances are high that you’re exploring the land of OTC.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>Another good tell for OTC products is that they’re designed for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. Prescription hearing aids, on the other hand, can address a much broader range of hearing loss needs.</p><p>Prescription hearing technology is more flexible in this way because they’re so customizable. Prescription aids can be tailored to your unique hearing profile, preferences, and listening environments. OTC products have more limited or fixed settings, so they can’t always adapt to you. As you work with us, you’ll get a first-hand taste of what this means.</p><p>Typically, another difference you’ll notice as a customer is the premium feel of going prescription compared to OTC. While OTC is good for a simple fix, prescription hearing aids usually incorporate advanced features and technologies. That can mean directional microphones, feedback cancellation, and fancy signal processing algorithms. The other half of the premium feel is professional support and follow-up care. Prescription hearing aids mean you get audiologist attention from your fitting to counseling to continuing check-ups.</p>",

They’re great options for someone who has no medical issues with their ears, has minimal hearing loss, and wants a basic “boost.” We like to use the analogy of “readers” or “cheaters” in the glasses realm. We have to give a loving PSA as audiologists that it is best practice to have a hearing test performed to assess your hearing loss(and confirm that earwax or underlying medical issues aren’t culprits). An audiologist can help you understand if prescription devices or OTC would serve you best. There’s power in knowing!</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>The most important deciding factor that makes OTC products good is whether or not they’re good for <strong>you</strong>! Your specific hearing, lifestyle, and needs when it comes to hearing correction will all play into whether OTC technologies are a good fit. Not to mention, what works for one person may not be the best support for another.</p><p>Some of the good to consider with OTC hearing technology is that it tends to be accessible, affordable, and convenient. What’s missing tends to be customization, professional guidance, and a lack of advanced features when compared to prescription technology.</p><p>With BLUEMOTH, you get the best of both worlds with all the pros of prescription hearing aids alongside a more convenient and life-friendly approach when you have the option to try your tech at home before you buy and access to a more equitable price point.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Hearing aids can’t restore the natural, normal function of the ear. But they can help you understand speech more clearly and generally make hearing easier.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>We don’t want to promise you anything we can’t deliver on. In reality, hearing aids won’t restore natural “normal” hearing. Although hearing technology is improving all the time, aids may not fully restore all the nuances of speech and sound perception. Everyone also has different auditory systems and processing abilities, so results may vary accordingly. Also, complex environments that are crowded or noisy may still be challenging, even with hearing aids.</p><p>That being said, while it may not perfectly restore hearing, technology can certainly enhance it and meaningfully improve your quality of life. Hearing devices can significantly improve communication and speech understanding. They can help you get back to all the things you love- the hobbies and conversations that get missed out on with hearing loss.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Hearing aids are incredible micro-technology with sophisticated sound processing. They keep getting smaller, faster, and better. Typically hearing aids come in a “bundled” fashion – meaning that you pay for the devices and all of the follow-up services provided. Hearing technology is definitely an investment in your overall health and wellness.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>Hearing technology has undoubtedly come a long way- it gets more high-tech with every passing year. While that’s good news for your ears, it can be bad news for your wallet. Part of what you pay for is all the investment into research and development of cutting-edge technologies and algorithms by manufacturers.</p><p>Part of what you’re paying for is also the best of care;the support of audiologists to evaluate your hearing and administer tests, as well as provide counseling, programming, and fitting services. Not to mention the professional follow-ups to ensure your hearing technology is the perfect fit and continues to grow and change with you and your hearing needs. With BLUEMOTH, your initial experience and follow-ups will connect you with audiologists who are passionate about making sure you get to hear better, better.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Any prescription hearing aid will provide noticeable improvement to your abilities to hear and understand, but they are not all created equal. Each company offers a different sound experience. This is one reason we’re so excited to provide the BLUEMOTH experience box. All of the device options will be programmed according to your unique hearing loss, but YOUR subjective experience of each device may vary greatly.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>Different brands can employ different features and technology in their hearing aids, with varying sophistication. Some brands might have specific innovations or features that set them apart from the competition.</p><p>Then there’s the question of style- different brands can vary significantly in their offered models, colors, and styles. Some brands might fit how you want your technology to look and feel better than others. It matters that you love the way your technology looks- you’ll be rocking it every day.</p><p>Another major factor is brand reputation and support. Some brands have established themselves as leaders in the hearing technology industry through a strong track record of reliable technology and customer satisfaction. Different companies can offer different support as a result, such as robust device servicing and easy access to customer care professionals.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Getting hearing technology for the first time can take a little bit of adjustment. Some are good to go right out of the gate. But here’s what the average person can expect: Once you’ve selected your devices, they will be pre-programmed for your specific hearing loss (based on the hearing test/audiogram results you uploaded). Go ahead and give those a whirl! See how they sound in a myriad of situations and environments. Then, should you want changes, book a Programming Appointment with one of our hearing healthcare experts. We can make adjustments remotely based on your experiences and feedback. We can also always help ensure they are physically comfortable and stay in your ears well.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>Your experience with BLUEMOTH isn’t just about awesome cutting edge tech, it’s also about having a team behind you.

            "question": "How long do hearing aids last?",
            "answer": "<p>Hearing aids can last a long time – these are the little engine that could, in most cases. On average, people buy hearing aids about every 4 years. Not because their current devices are dead or not working anymore. It’s usually because there have been enough advances in technology that the benefits of new hearing aids warrant the purchase price. Things such as keeping them dry, proper care, maintenance, and routine cleaning will help the longevity of your devices. </p><p>Fun Fact: The oldest set of working devices we’ve ever seen worn and running on a patient was 18 years old! That person was super happy when they graduated into new tech – night and day difference.</p><h3><strong>Gimme more!</strong></h3><p>Your hearing tech is a really hard worker. It’s with you day in and day out, which naturally leads to wear and tear. However, the lifespan of your hearing technology isn’t just centered around when it starts falling apart. Really, the lifespan of your hearing technology has a lot to do with your needs and how they might change.</p><p>Think about the person you were 4 years ago. Chances are, something has evolved as you’ve lived and grown. Maybe you’ve picked up new hobbies, and now you can’t get enough of surfing or cooking classes. Maybe you’ve headed back into a classroom or into a new job. Eventually, you may find that you’ve outgrown your hearing tech and something new would be a better fit for your lifestyle.</p>",

Whether you’re finding joy in hot yoga, hitting a trail, or visiting the beach, this new generation of hearing technology will be right there with you.</p><p>Computers and water aren’t really best friends, so we do not recommend getting your hearing technology wet if you don’t know that it’s specifically designed for that. If you have a specific set of devices in mind for this question, the best thing to do is to check out the specifications of the device model. You can find this on manufacturer websites, or by reaching out to a customer support representative. Many modern hearing aids are safe to use in the rain and hold up well to sweat. </p>",

Wearing your devices to bed can risk your devices falling out and getting lost or damaged. Plus, it’s a great chance to let your ears breathe and get air circulating.

However, there are some super common things we like to share to set proper expectations at the outset.</p><h3><strong>Down the rabbit hole.</strong></h3><p>Some things you may notice after being fit with hearing aids are:</p><ul><li>Every day sounds like running water, a bag of chips rustling, or your turn signal may seem super loud in the first days or weeks.</li><li>Things may sound tinnier (high-pitched).</li><li>“S” sounds may sound sharper.</li><li>Understanding speech in background noise will be drastically less difficult.</li></ul>",
